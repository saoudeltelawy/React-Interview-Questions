    <h3 class="subject-title">React:</h3>
    <h4>1. What do props help us accomplish?</h4>
    <p>
      As parameters passed in functions so props passed into compeonents and
      that Make a component more reusable <em>so that</em> we can keep our code
      as dry as possible.
    </p>

    <h4>
      2. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native DOM
      element? (e.g. <code><div blahblahblah="{true}"></div></code> ) Why or why
      not?
    </h4>
    <p>
      No, because the JSX we use to describe native DOM elements will be turned
      into REAL DOM elements by React. And real DOM elements only have the
      prooperties/attributes specified in the HTML specification. (Which doesn't
      include properties like `blahblahblah`) but this can be for
      <code>
        <span class="bold-highighted">
          &lt;MyAwesomeHeader title="???" /&gt;
        </span>
      </code>
    </p>

    <h4>3. What data type is [props] when the component receives it.</h4>
    <p>An object!</p>

    <h4>4.What does the `.map()` array method do?</h4>
    <p>
      Returns a new array. Whatever gets returned from the callback function
      provided is placed at the same index in the new array <br />
      [Usually we take the items from the original array and modify them in some
      way.]
    </p>

    <h4>5. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?</h4>
    <p>
      Convert an array of raw data into an array of JSX elements that can be
      displayed on the page.
    </p>

    <h4>
      6. Why is using `.map()` better than just creating the components manually
      by typing them out?
    </h4>
    <p>
      It makes our code more "self-sustaining" - not requiring additional
      changes whenever the data changes.
    </p>

    <h4>7. How would you describe the concept of "state"?</h4>
    <p>
      State refers to values that a component can maitain between render cycles
      |OR Let's Say| 'State' in ReactJS? ...... The state is a built-in React
      object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A
      component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component
      re-renders.
    </p>

    <h4>8. When would you want to use props instead of state?</h4>
    <p>
      Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that component can
      determine what will get displayed on the screen.
    </p>

    <h4>9. When would you want to use state instead of props?</h4>
    <p>
      Anytime you want a component to maintain some values from within the
      component. (And "remember" those values even when React re-renders the
      component)
    </p>

    <h4>
      10. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Immutable means unchanging ... Props are immutable & State is mutable.[As
      we do plab to change the state]
    </p>

    <h4>
      11. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a state setter function
      (e.g. `setCount`). What are they?
    </h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        New value of state (setCount(42)) Callback function - whatever the
      </li>
      <li>callback function returns === new value of state</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <h4>
      12. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer above) to
      the state setter function?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Whenever you don't need the previous value of state to determine what the
      new value of state should be.
    </p>

    <h4>
      13. Whenever you don't need the previous value of state to determine what
      the new value of state should be.
    </h4>
    <p>Whenever you DO need the previous value to determine the new value</p>
